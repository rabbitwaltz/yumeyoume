First, I was taught how to

1. make an unordered list
2. put things in it
3. and then make an ordered list

```
1. and then given some homework
2. make a cheatsheet
3. figure out how to use ```
4. it's called a fence!
```

An unordered list:
- looks like this
- bananas
- carrots
- salmon
- but not together in one dish

```
- it's simple
- I use it in my analog two dimensional writing device stack
- for things like groceries
```

I'm not sure how to use

'code'

yet, because I just found another cheatsheet which I'm using to learn how to make this cheatsheet, but it looks like:

```
'code'
```

This thing is getting ridiculously long, so maybe this will help

This nice divide is written like this

This cheatsheet would probably drive anyone else other than its author to distraction.

I was hunting around for an image, so I thought I'd recommend this film:

And here's how I did it:

I was told I could get extra credit by learning some useful goodies like this handy-dandy table.

| Element | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| **bold** | ``` **bold** ``` |
| *italic* | ``` *italic* ``` |
| ```fence``` | `` ```testing``` `` |
| ~~nope~~ | ``` ~~strikethrough~~ ```|

and here's how
